<p>I did not enjoy John Mark Comer’s book <em>The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry</em>.</p>

<p>Comer’s book is written to people trying to find meaning in a world that feels rushed, distracted, and isolated. At the time of writing, Comer was a Protestant pastor in Portland, Oregon, but he’s since stepped back to focus on creating resources for spiritual formation (like this book).</p>

<p>The book takes its title from a quote by Christian philosopher Dallas Willard:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Hurry is the great enemy of spiritual life in our day. You must ruthlessly eliminate hurry from your life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the book, Comer argues that hurry is incompatible with love (p. 23), patience (p. 23), joy (p. 25), peace (p. 25), wisdom (p. 52), gratitude (p. 52). Hurry is a sign that we aren’t accepting our God-given limitations (p. 65), and hurrying causes irritability, restlessness, distraction, and isolation (pp. 27, 58, 89).</p>

<p>The base state of man before the modern era, Comer argues, was unhurried (pp. 42–45). God rests in Genesis 1, and Jesus himself never hurried. The cure to our modern malaise, thus, is to embrace a life marked by slowness, solitude, simplicity, prayer, and rest. Comer advocates taking a literal 24-hour sabbath, rejecting consumerism, and trying to find a “perpetual Zen-like state of Jesus-derived joy and peace” (p. 251).</p>

<p>Much of what Comer says is good. But the central argument of his piece, that hurrying should be eliminated, doesn’t seem defensible to me. Comer makes very few direct arguments that hurrying itself is bad, instead using hurrying as a metonym for a vaguely defined bucket of negative modern traits: isolation, anxiety, fear, and so on.</p>

<p>This is a classic example of a motte-and-bailey argument, popularized by Scott Alexander on <em>Slate Star Codex</em>. In his post <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/03/all-in-all-another-brick-in-the-motte/">“All In All, Another Brick In The Motte”</a>, he defines a motte-and-bailey argument thusly:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>So the motte-and-bailey doctrine is when you make a bold, controversial statement. Then when somebody challenges you, you retreat to an obvious, uncontroversial statement, and say that was what you meant all along, so you’re clearly right and they’re silly for challenging you. Then when the argument is over you go back to making the bold, controversial statement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Comer does exactly this. “You must ruthlessly eliminate hurrying” is a bold, controversial statement—but the statement he actually defends is more like “anxiety and isolation are bad,” which doesn’t have quite the same transformative implications for modern Christian living.</p>

<p>I’ll go a step further and try to defend the assertion that hurrying can be good, actually. Here’s Genesis 18:1–8 (ESV), when Abraham receives God at Mamre (emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>And the Lord appeared to [Abraham] by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat at the door of his tent in the heat of the day. He lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, three men were standing in front of him. When he saw them, <strong>he ran from the tent door to meet them</strong> and bowed himself to the earth...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s a few other passages defending the practice of hurrying:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Lot is commanded by angels to flee in a hurry from Sodom (Genesis 19).</li>
    <li>In Exodus 12, the Passover meal is to be eaten in haste.</li>
    <li>After Ziklag is raided and taken captive by the Amalekites, David and his soldiers pursue them (1 Samuel 30).</li>
    <li>Elisha commands Gehazi to “run at once” to meet the Shunammite woman (2 Kings 4).</li>
    <li>After Mary receives the revelation from Gabriel, she “went with haste” to Elizabeth (Luke 1:39).</li>
    <li>The father of the prodigal son runs out to greet him (Luke 15).</li>
    <li>Philip runs to the Ethiopian eunuch in his chariot (Acts 8).</li>
    <li>Paul urges Timothy to come “soon” and “before winter” (2 Timothy 4:9, 21).</li>
</ul>

<p>These points may seem obvious—clearly, if Amalekite raiders carried off your family, you would hurry after them! But even a trivial example like this demonstrates that hurrying is not intrinsically opposed to the will of God.</p>

<p>Comer argues that Jesus himself never hurried (p. 92). This is debatable—Mark uses the word “immediately” to describe many of Jesus’s actions, but that may reflect a Markean narrative style. Jesus himself commands Zaccheus to hurry (Luke 19:5), and his anger cleansing the temple should dispel the idea that Jesus perpetually existed in a “Zen-like” state.</p>

<p>The conclusion here is not that we should hurry more. Most people hurry for bad reasons, but the call of Christianity is to align desires with God’s will. As Rene Girard says in <em>I Saw Satan Fall Like Lightning</em> (p. 13):</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>What Jesus invites us to imitate is his own <em>desire</em>, the spirit that directs towards the goal on which his intention is fixed: to resemble God the Father as much as possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What we are willing to hurry for reflects what we care about. Abraham hurries to show hospitality, David hurries to save captives, and Mary hurries to share the gospel. We should care enough about these things that we’re willing to hurry for them.</p>

<p>Comer’s call to a life of virtue, peace, and rest is excellent—but the central claim of the book is just not correct.</p>
