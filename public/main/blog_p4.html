<p>
<i>In this post, I’m trying something new and embedding calculations on Rowan alongside the text. You can view the structures and energies right in the page, or you can follow a link and view the full data in a new tab. While PDFs and printed journals are limited to displaying 2D renditions of 3D structures, there’s no reason why websites should follow suit—and now that all my calculations are already on the web, it’s simple to share the primary data.</i>
</p>

<p>
The 2-norbornyl cation has a special place in the history of physical organic chemistry. <a href=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja01176a536>In 1949</a>, following up on <a href=https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/1939/jr/jr9390001188>previous work</a> by Christopher Wilson, the great physical organic chemist Saul Winstein observed that acetolysis of <i>exo</i>-norbornyl sulfonates occurred about 350 times faster than solvolysis of the corresponding <i>endo</i> compounds.
</p>

<figure>
  <img class=centered-img src=../img/20240103_summary.png style="width:550px;" />
  <figcaption>“X” represents a leaving group and “Nu” a nucleophile.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
Several stereochemical observations indicated that something puzzling was going on: both the <i>exo</i> and <i>endo</i> sulfonates gave <i>exo</i> acetate product, but enantioenriched <i>exo</i>-norbornyl sulfonate formed racemic <i>exo</i>-norbornyl acetate. Winstein argued that this data was best explained through the participation of an achiral nonclassical carbocation (“<b>II</b>”) featuring σ-delocalization and a three-center two-electron bond, as shown in the conclusion of the 1949 paper:
</p>

<figure>
  <img class=centered-img src=../img/20240103_winstein.png style="width:400px;" />
</figure>

<p>
The nonclassical structure, “<b>II</b>” above, is a little tough to visualize as drawn. Here’s the computed structure at the B3LYP-D3BJ/6-31G(d) level of theory, which should be a bit clearer. You can click on atoms to see bond distances, angles, and dihedrals; notice that the C1–C2 bond above (C14–C18 in Rowan) is markedly shorter than a normal C–C bond, whereas the C1–C6 and C2–C6 bonds (C13–C14 and C14–C18 in Rowan) are quite long.
</p>

<iframe src=https://labs.rowansci.com/iframe2/calculations/75efc4da-b19c-42d4-a49c-cb454741cb93 style="height:400px;width:400px;"></iframe>

<p>
In the 1960s Winstein’s interpretation was challenged by another preeminent chemist, H.C. Brown, who argued that the data could adequately be explained by rapidly equilibrating classical carbocations. Brown suggested that most of the observations made by Winstein could be explained simply by the differing steric profiles of the <i>exo</i> and <i>endo</i> faces of the norbornyl cation: the <i>endo</i> face is more shielded, and so ionization is slowed (explaining the 350:1 <i>exo</i>/<i>endo</i> rates) and attack is disfavored (explaining why both isomers of sulfonate give <i>exo</i> product). 
</p>

<p>
This began an incredibly contentious series of debates which dragged on for decades. Rather than attempt to wade through the resulting sea of publications, I’ll quote from <a href=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ar00096a004>an excellent 1983 review</a> by Cheves Walling to give a sense for the magnitude of the controversy: 
</p>

<blockquote>
The debate [over the structure of the norbornyl cation] was vigorously pursued verbally in lectures, meetings, and seminars all over the U.S. and even abroad…. No one has ever counted the number of publications touching on the 2-norbornyl cation problem, but they include a number of reviews, chapters, and books, and a typcial <i>[sic]</i> research paper may well include references to over 100 others. 
</blockquote>

<p>
Walling’s review goes on to give an excellent overview of the various pieces of evidence employed by both sides of the debate, which I won’t summarize in full here. 
</p>

<p>
The most important data was obtained by George Olah and co-workers, who pioneered the use of superacidic media to generate stable solutions of carbocations which could be characterized spectroscopically. With Martin Saunders and others, Olah employed <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and core electron spectroscopy to study low-temperature solutions of norbornyl cations: in all cases, the data supported Winstein’s proposed symmetric structure. (While equilibration occurring faster than the spectroscopic timescale could not be ruled out by Olah’s work, spectroscopic measurements all the way down to 5 K showed no detectable classical structures, indicating that any barrier to interconversion must be &lt;0.2 kcal/mol.)

<p><b>
Note: <a href=https://twitter.com/dasingleton/status/1742754148221649214>On Twitter/X</a>, Dan Singleton argues that the controversy was largely settled by 1982 and attributes this to the <a href=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ar00096a003>Saunders/Olah NMR experiments</a> and <a href=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ar00096a001>Cyril Grob's work in this area</a>, which I didn't mention. I appreciate the correction and welcome any further additions to the record.
</b></p>

<p>
Computational chemistry, which became able to tackle problems like this in the late 1980s and early 1990s, also supported the nonclassical structure of the norbornyl cation. <a href=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja00186a073>A 1990 paper</a> used HF/6-31G(d) calculations in Gaussian 86 to show that the symmetric structure was a minimum on the potential energy surface. Here’s a scan I ran at the B3LYP-D3BJ/6-31G(d) level of theory, showing that the energy increases as the “classical” C–C bond forms:

<p>
Subsequent work has confirmed that Winstein was almost completely correct about the key issues. Most notably, <a href=https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1238849>a 2013 crystal structure</a> from Karsten Meyer demonstrates that the norbornyl cation is indeed nonclassical in the ground state, leading <i>Chemistry World</i> to <a href=https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/crystal-structure-closes-classic-carbocation-case/6352.article>declare the mystery solved</a>. Nevertheless, there’s still a little room for a classical cation supporter to doubt this result: crystal structures are snapshots of solid-state atomic configurations, while reactions occur in solution, where molecules are free to move around more. (In the <i>Chemistry World</i> article, Paul Schleyer predicts that Brown himself would have raised this objection.) 
</p>

<p>
A paper from Ken Houk and co-workers, <a href=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.joc.3c02325>published a few days ago in <i>JOC</i></a>, addresses this issue by directly modeling the solvolysis process through <i>ab initio</i> molecular dynamics with explicit acetic acid solvent. In the solvolysis of the <i>exo</i> sulfonate, the authors find the nonclassical cation is formed on average within 9 femtoseconds of C–O bond cleavage, which is about as quickly as is physically possible. Once formed, the cation is entirely nonclassical: “classical 2-norbornyl cations are a negligible component of norbornyl cations in solution," thus addressing the last objection of classical cation partisans.
</p>

<figure>
  <img class=centered-img src=../img/20240103_houk.jpeg style="width:550px;" />
  <figcaption>
    Simulations of the norbornyl cation in explicit acetic acid show complete nonclassical behavior (Figure 6 from Houk’s paper).
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
In contrast, Houk et al find that the <i>endo</i> sulfonate doesn’t form the nonclassical cation until about 81 fs after the C–O bond breaks, explaining the slower reaction rate: the transition state isn’t stabilized by σ-dissociation, and so is higher in energy. This is a nice example of the principle of nonperfect synchronization, which is explained concisely in <a href=https://macmillan.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/PJS-Group-Meeting-no-layering.pdf>this presentation</a>.
</p>

<br>
<div class=dinkus>* * *</div>
<br>

<p>
What can modern scientists learn from the norbornyl cation controversy, besides the object-level fact that carbocations can exhibit nonclassical σ-delocalization?
</p>

<h3>1. Reality is confusing, and convincing arguments are often wrong.</h3> 

<p>
It’s a good exercise to go back and read the early H.C. Brown papers in this area, like <a href=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ar50071a003>this account</a>. Brown was an incredible scientist (the 1979 Nobel laureate in chemistry), and his data and reasoning are quite good; I find myself sympathizing with his viewpoint while reading his papers. Nevertheless, with the benefit of hindsight we know that he was wrong and Winstein was right. “Humility comes before honor.”
</p>

<h3>2. Tools drive scientific progress.</h3> 
<p>
The argument over the norbornyl cation was ultimately settled only by the development of new techniques, like superacid chemistry, core electron spectroscopy, and high-level calculations. Now that we have these methods, it’s much easier to solve similar problems: if Winstein’s paper came out today, I doubt it would take more than a year or two to figure everything out. 
</p>

<p>
This aligns nicely with what <a href=https://estudosdects.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/dyson-science-ideas-or-tools.pdf>Freeman Dyson</a> calls a “Galisonian” view of scientific progress, where scientific progress is driven not by ideas (the “Kuhnian” view) but by new tools and new data. In chemistry, at least, the tools-first view seems true to me—since 1950, it’s difficult to think of a development more important to organic chemistry than NMR spectroscopy, with flash column chromatography probably taking second place.
</p>

<h3>3. It’s easy for fields to get distracted by controversy and lose relevance.</h3> 
<p>
Here’s Walling again:
</p>

<blockquote>
Since a significant fraction of the efforts of physical organic chemists was drawn into the problem [of the norbornyl cation], an unhappy consequence was a feeling on the part of many (including some of those concerned with the distribution of research funds) that physical organic chemistry was in danger of withdrawing into a world of its own.
</blockquote>

<p>
As older scientists have explained to me, the norbornyl cation debacle scared a generation of chemists away from physical organic chemistry. The entire subfield became obsessed with a niche and somewhat irrelevant issue, while scientists in adjacent subfields looked on with bemusement and frustration. As a consequence, traditional physical organic chemistry is barely practiced today: few scientists have the skill or knowledge to conduct kinetic studies like those performed by Winstein, Brown, and others, and those still working in the area struggle to get funding or recognition (in the words of Dan Singleton, <a href=https://twitter.com/dasingleton/status/1275932027825664000>“sucks when you have to peddle your papers in cemeteries”</a>).
</p>

<p>
(In <a href=http://acshist.scs.illinois.edu/bulletin_open_access/v25-2/v25-2%20p123-131.pdf>a nice historical perspective</a>, Stephen Weininger argues the norbornyl cation debate was “a hook on which to hang a much larger agenda,” fueled both by a UK/US divide and a deeper dispute about whether valence bond representations or molecular orbital representations of chemical structures were superior. If this is true, it was a self-defeating exercise by all involved.)
</p>

<p>
Scientists should be motivated by a search for truth, but also by the desire to improve the world. Usually these two aims go together: basic research without obvious societal implications often leads to unexpected and important findings, which is why the government supports science in the first place. But it’s possible to become so myopically focused on a single issue in the name of truth that one forgets about other goals, as arguably happened in the norbornyl cation imbroglio.
</p>

<p>
Controversy attracts attention: we’re drawn to it, against our better judgment, like moths to a flame. We have to be careful not to get captured by disputes that are, in the long run, not worth the effort.

<p>
Many great works of literature are notable for their brevity: when you read Hemingway, or <i>Dubliners</i>, or Flannery O’Connor, you know that every sentence has been crafted with care. Giant fantasy novels like <i>Wheel of Time</i> (which I read last year) or <i>The Stormlight Archives</i> work differently. There are entire chapters which are probably extraneous, whole characters and plot arcs which exist merely to bring out certain traits or pieces of information.
</p>

<p>
But there are unique joys to megafiction: sitting down and reading hundreds of pages of a good story is relaxing in a way that other books simply aren’t. In my own life, I’ve found that I’m much better about making time to read when I’m in the middle of an engaging novel than when I’m reading theology or histories of feudalism. Narrative-driven “easy reading” has a bad reputation amongst the literati; in a world where all fiction is competing against screens for engagement, it shouldn’t.

<p>
The best book I read this year by a mile; far better than I remembered. While many of <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> work pretty well as literature, they’re even better when viewed also as history. It’s rare to be able to read something from 800 years ago that’s legitimately funny and interesting.
</p>

<p>
Reading Chaucer fills me with questions about the medieval mind. The stories are steeped in Christianity, as one might expect. Any argument goes back to the Bible, even those among animals, and Chaucer assumes a level of familiarity with e.g. the Psalms far exceeding that of most modern Christians. Yet at the same time the Greco-Roman world looms large: Roman gods appear as plot characters in three tales (the Knight’s Tale, the Merchant’s Tale, and the Manciple’s Tale), and Seneca is viewed as a moral authority on par with Scripture. I’m curious how all these beliefs and ideas fit together and welcome any recommendations on this subject. (<i>The Discarded Image</i> is already on my list.)

Overall, about a third of the books I read were startup-related: most of them were pretty bad, but even bad business/startup books are probably useful from the viewpoint of cultural immersion. Academic science is quite different from the startup ecosystem, and to the extent that cultural arbitrage is possible (in either direction), I need to become proficient in startup culture.
</p>

<p>
I’m not sure why the median business book is so bad—perhaps business people are too willing to spend money on books and not picky enough, or perhaps MBA types generally lack knowledge about the humanities, which makes both supply and demand worse.
</p>

<p>
(The median Christian book is also pretty bad. One unifying hypothesis: both pastors and businesspeople often have wise insights into specific situations, personal or business, but these insights aren’t readily generalizable into book form. Being able to give good advice doesn’t mean you should write an “advice book.”)
</p>

<p>
As always, book recommendations are welcome, particularly on the topics of medieval history/culture, software engineering, or startups. Apologies for the infrequent posting as of late, and happy new year!

<p>
As machine learning becomes more and more important to chemistry, it’s worth reflecting on Richard Sutton’s 2019 blog post about the “bitter lesson.” In <a href=http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html>this now-famous post</a>, Sutton argues that “the biggest lesson that can be read from 70 years of AI research is that general methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin.” This might sound obvious, but it’s not:
</p>

<blockquote>
[The bitter lesson] is a big lesson. As a field, we still have not thoroughly learned it, as we are continuing to make the same kind of mistakes. To see this, and to effectively resist it, we have to understand the appeal of these mistakes. We have to learn the bitter lesson that building in how we think we think does not work in the long run. The bitter lesson is based on the historical observations that 1) AI researchers have often tried to build knowledge into their agents, 2) this always helps in the short term, and is personally satisfying to the researcher, but 3) in the long run it plateaus and even inhibits further progress, and 4) breakthrough progress eventually arrives by an opposing approach based on scaling computation by search and learning. <u>The eventual success is tinged with bitterness, and often incompletely digested, because it is success over a favored, human-centric approach.</u> <i>(emphasis added)</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
How might the bitter lesson be relevant in chemistry? One example is computer-assisted retrosynthesis in organic synthesis, i.e. figuring out how to make a given target from commercial starting materials. This task was first attempted by Corey’s LHASA program (<a href=https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_2549520/component/file_3325899/content>1</a>, <a href=https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/corey-lecture.pdf>2</a>), and more recently has been addressed by Bartosz Gryzbowski’s <a href=https://www.cell.com/chem/pdf/S2451-9294(18)30085-8.pdf>Synthia</a>. Despite considerable successes, both efforts have operated through manual encoding of human chemical intuition. If Sutton is to be believed, we should be pessimistic about the scalability and viability of such approaches relative to pure search-based alternatives in the coming years.
</p>

<p>
Another example is machine-learned force fields (like ANI or NequIP). While one could argue that equivariant neural networks like <i>e3nn</i> aren’t so much incorporating domain-specific knowledge as exploiting relevant symmetries (much like convolutional neural networks exploit translational symmetry in images), there’s been a movement in recent years to combine chemistry-specific forces (e.g. long-range Coulombic forces) with neural networks: Parkhill’s <a href=https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/sc/c7sc04934j>TensorMol</a> did this back in 2018, and more recently <a href=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27340-2>Dral</a>, <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08734>Piquemal</a>, and <a href=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jacs.3c07628>Levitt &amp; Fain</a> (<a href=https://twitter.com/olexandr/status/1730604569028092081>among others</a>) have published on this as well. While I’m no expert in this area, the bitter lesson suggests that we should be skeptical about the long-term viability of efforts, and instead just throw more data at chemistry-agnostic models. 
</p>

<p>
A key assumption of the bitter lesson is that “over a slightly longer time than a typical research project, massively more computation inevitably becomes available.” This idea has also been discussed by Andrej Karpathy, who <a href=https://karpathy.github.io/2022/03/14/lecun1989/>reproduced</a> Yann LeCun’s landmark 1989 backpropagation paper last year using state-of-the-art techniques and reflected on how the field has progressed since then. In particular, Karpathy discussed how the last three decades of progress in ML can help us envision what the next three decades might look like:
</p>

<blockquote>
Suppose that the lessons of this exercise remain invariant in time. What does that imply about deep learning of 2022? What would a time traveler from 2055 think about the performance of current networks?
<ul>
<li>
2055 neural nets are basically the same as 2022 neural nets on the macro level, except bigger.

Our datasets and models today look like a joke. Both are somewhere around 10,000,000X larger.

One can train 2022 state of the art models in ~1 minute by training naively on their personal computing device as a weekend fun project.

Today’s models are not optimally formulated, and just changing some of the details of the model, loss function, augmentation or the optimizer we can about halve the error.

Our datasets are too small, and modest gains would come from scaling up the dataset alone.

<li>
Further gains are actually not possible without expanding the computing infrastructure and investing into some R&D on effectively training models on that scale.

<p>
If we take this seriously, we might expect that chemical ML will not be able to advance much farther without bigger datasets and bigger models. Today, experimental datasets rarely exceed 10<sup>4</sup>–10<sup>5</sup> data points, and even computational datasets typically comprise 10<sup>7</sup> data points or fewer—compare this to the ~10<sup>13</sup> tokens <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/14wbmio/gpt4_details_leaked/>reportedly used to train GPT-4</a>! It’s not obvious how to get experimental datasets that are this large. HTE and robotics will help, but five orders of magnitude is a big ask. Even all of Reaxys doesn’t get you to 10<sup>8</sup>, poor data quality notwithstanding. (It’s probably not a coincidence that DNA-encoded libraries, which can actually have hundreds of millions of data points, also pair nicely with ML: I’ve written about this <a href=https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230403_industry.html>before</a>.)
</p>

<p>
In contrast, computation permits the predictable generation of high-quality datasets. If Sutton is right about the inevitable availability of “massively more computation,” then we can expect it to become easier and easier to run hitherto expensive calculations like DFT in parallel to generate huge datasets, and to enable more and more downstream applications like chemical machine learning. With the right infrastructure (like Rowan, hopefully), it should be possible to turn computer time into high-quality chemical data with almost no non-financial scaling limit: <a href=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ci300415d>we’re certainly not going to run out of molecules</a>.
</p>

<p>
The advent of big data, though, heralds the decline of academic relevance. Julian Togelius and Georgios Yannakakis wrote about this earlier this year in a piece on <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06035?s=03>“survival strategies for depressed AI academics,”</a> which discusses the fact that “the gap between the amount of compute available to ordinary researchers and the amount available to stay competitive is growing every year.” For instance, GPT-4 reportedly cost c. $60 million to train, far surpassing any academic group’s budget. Togelius and Yannakakis provide a lot of potential solutions, some sarcastic (“give up”) and others quite constructive—for instance, lots of interpretability work (<a href=https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features/index.html>like this</a>) is done on toy models that don’t require GPT-4 levels of training. Even the most hopeful scenarios they present, however, still leave academics with a rather circumscribed role in the ML ecosystem. 
</p>
 
<p>
The present academic era of chemical machine learning can thus be taken as a sign of the field’s immaturity. When will chemical ML reach a Suttonian era where scaling is paramount and smaller efforts become increasingly futile? I’m not sure, but my guess is that it will happen when (and only when) there are clear commercial incentives for developing sophisticated models, enabling companies to sink massive amounts of capital into training and development. This clearly hasn’t happened yet, but it also might not be as far away as it seems (<a href=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06735-9>cf.</a>). It’s an interesting time to be a computational chemist…

<p>
I took a pistol course in undergrad, and while I was a poor marksman I enjoyed the experience. In particular, I was surprised by how meditative the act of shooting was. As our instructor explained, much of good shooting comes down to not doing anything when you pull the trigger. When you’re not firing, it’s easy to point a gun at a target and line up the sights, but as you pull the trigger you subconsciously anticipate the noise and movement of the pistol blast, which makes you flinch and pull the gun off-target. Being a good shooter thus requires consciously learning to counteract what your instincts tell you to do.
</p>

<p>
If you believe Bill Carr and Colin Bryar’s book on Amazon, <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Working-Backwards-Insights-Stories-Secrets/dp/1250267595><i>Working Backwards</i></a>, Amazon’s success can be understood in similar terms. According to Carr and Bryar, Amazon alone among the West Coast zaibatsu has succeeded not because of some big technical or social insight (Google Search, Windows) but because of a long series of canny business decisions. Bezos has said something similar: “Amazon doesn't have one big advantage, so we have to braid a rope out of many small advantages.” The implication is that you too can build an Amazon-quality firm; you don’t need any flashes of mad genius, just the ability to eke out small advantages through savvy management.
</p>

<p>
(This might seem like an insane claim, but it’s worth noting that Amazon has indeed launched a ton of successful and loosely coupled businesses: in addition to their core commerce business, there’s AWS, Amazon Robotics, Kindle, Prime Video, Fire TV, and a bunch of other stuff. Contrast this to Google’s recent track record…)
</p>

<p>
What’s more, Carr and Bryar go on to argue that Amazon’s business acumen is driven not by some inscrutable Bezos magic but by adherence to a simple set of principles. And these principles aren’t esoteric or Amazon-specific—almost any business can follow them. The reason so few businesses have copied Amazon’s success is simply because each principle defies human nature in some way. Just like pistol shooting requires one to unlearn one’s instincts and pull the trigger without moving any other muscles, being an “Amazonian” business requires discarding what you think you understand about building a business and going back to basics.
</p>

<p>
So, what are these magic principles?
</p>

<h2>
1. Focus on Customers, Not Competitors
</h2>

<p>
Focusing on competitors is human nature—in a competition, we judge ourselves based on our rivals, and like to imagine how we’ll defeat them. But success in business comes from satisfied customers, not vanquished foes, and keeping a relentless focus on users/customers is key to building something great. This is hardly Amazon-specific wisdom: “build something people want” is <a href=https://www.ycombinator.com/library/4D-yc-s-essential-startup-advice>venerable YC advice</a>, and <i>Zero to One</i> also makes the point that competition is bad and focusing on it counterproductive. Perhaps the fact that so many different people feel the need to emphasize this point speaks to how counterintuitive it is: were it widely adopted, it wouldn’t be repeated.
</p>

<p>
Plenty of people outside business also get this wrong. A few weeks ago, a friend was explaining how he feels that many computational chemists are making software not for users but for other computational chemists. This is a case in which writing papers leads to different incentives than releasing products: papers are reviewed by one’s peers (other computational chemists), while products are ultimately reviewed by users. Hopefully Rowan doesn’t make this mistake…
</p>

<h2>
2. “Bar Raisers”: External Vetos in Hiring
</h2>

<p>
Amazon includes a person called a “Bar Raiser” involved in all hiring decisions, who isn’t the hiring manager (the person who is trying to acquire a new team member) but who has final veto power on any potential hire. The hiring manager is hiring because they need help in the short term, so they’re typically willing to engage in wishful thinking and lower their standards—but the Bar Raiser (who’s just another Amazon employee, with a bit of extra training) has no such incentives and can make sure that no poor performers are hired, which is better for Amazon in the long run.
</p>

<p>
I like this idea because it’s a nice example of mechanism design: just a little bit of internal red-teaming which (according to the book) works quite well. (Red teaming is another one of those “good but counterintuitive practices” which seems underutilized—see <a href=https://open.substack.com/pub/statecraftnotes/p/how-to-predict-the-future?r=5jsaw&selection=302a6711-1b29-4791-aedc-0320932bac7a&utm_campaign=post-share-selection&utm_medium=web>the discussion</a> in a recent <i>Statecraft</i> interview.)
</p>

<h2>
3. Problem-Focused, Not Skills-Focused
</h2>

<p>
It’s natural to think about what we should do next in terms of what we’re good at: “I’m good at X, how can I use X to solve a problem?” Carr and Bryar argue that “working forwards” in this way is stupid, because only at the end do you think about who (if anyone) might care if you succeed. “Working backwards” from problem to solution is a much better strategy: first you articulate what you might need to accomplish to produce a compelling solution, and then you think about if you can do it. Inside Amazon, most potential new projects start out by drafting what the press release might be if the project were finished, and then working backwards from the press release to what the product must be. (Most products envisioned in this way never actually get developed, which is exactly the point of the exercise.)
</p>

<p>
<a href=https://intra.ece.ucr.edu/~rlake/Whitesides_writing_res_paper.pdf>George Whitesides</a> has advocated for a similar way to approach science: first write the paper, then conduct the experiments. Lots of scientists I know find this repulsive, or contrary to how science should be practiced, but it always seemed shrewd to me—if you can’t make an interesting paper out of what you’re doing, why are you doing it? (Exploratory work can be tough to outline in this way, but there should be several potential papers in such cases, not none.)
</p>

<h2>
4. Single-Threaded Leadership
</h2>

<p>
As organizations scale, it becomes tougher and tougher to allow teams to work autonomously, and responsibility and authority for almost all projects ends up bestowed upon the same small number of people. This makes insightful innovation hard: to quote Amazon SVP of Devices Dave Limp, “the best way to fail at inventing something is by making it somebody’s part-time job.” Amazon’s solution is the idea of single-threaded leadership (STL, probably someone’s idea of C++ humor). Organizations need to be arranged such that individual teams can respond to their problems intelligently and independently, planning and shipping features on their own, and each team needs to have a “single-threaded leader” solely responsible for leading that team.
</p>

<p>
Instituting STL takes a good amount of initial planning, since dividing up a giant monolith into loosely coupled components is tough both for software and for humans, and it’s not in the nature of authorities to relinquish control. If done properly, though, this allows innovation to happen much faster than if every decision is bottlenecked by reliance on the C-suite. (It’s sorta like federalism for businesses.)
</p>

<p>
This idea matters for labs, too: some research groups rely on their PI for scientific direction in every project, while others devolve a lot of authority to individual students. The latter seem more productive to me.
</p>

<h2>
5. Bias Towards Action
</h2>

<p>
Humans are by nature conservative, and sins of commission frequently feel worse than sins of omission—making a bad decision can cost you your job, while not making a good decision often goes unnoticed (the <a href=https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2015/08/is-the-fda-too-conservative-or-too-aggressive.html>“invisible graveyard”</a>). To counteract this, Amazon expects leaders to display a “Bias for Action.” In their words:
</p>

<blockquote>
Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk-taking.
</blockquote>

<p>
Again, this echoes classic startup advice: “launch now,” “do things that don’t scale,” &amp;c.
</p>

<h2>
6. No Powerpoint!
</h2>

<p>
In June 2004, Amazon banned PowerPoint presentations from meetings, instead expecting presenters to compose six-page documents which the entire team would read, silently, at the beginning of each meeting. Why? A few reasons:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
PowerPoint lends itself poorly to complex or nuanced ideas, whereas written documents can contain more information and more complete chains of reasoning.
</li>
<li>
PowerPoint leads to “slick,” well-rehearsed presentations where the presenter’s style and charisma matters as much as the underlying ideas.
</li>
<li>
Writing enforces greater clarity of thought than speaking.
</li>
<li>
PowerPoint makes the audience passive, while reading makes the audience active participants in the ideas. People like to be passive, and it’s fun to hear an inspiring presentation, but in the long run it’s better for everyone to actually engage.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I’m pretty sympathetic to these criticisms. Most high-stakes academic events today revolve around oral presentations, not papers—although papers still matter, doctorates, job offers, and tenure are awarded largely on the merits of hour-long talks (<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7HeQGQQ0q8>e.g.</a>). As a result, I spent a ridiculous amount of my PhD just refining and hearing feedback on my presentations, much of which had nothing to do with the underlying scientific ideas. Perhaps this focus on showmanship over substance explains why so little science today seems genuinely transformational. (It’s also worth noting that presenting, much more so than writing, favors charismatic Americans over the meek or foreign.)
</p>

<p>
There are, of course, more than just these six ideas in <i>Working Backwards</i>, but I think this gives a pretty good sense of what the book is like. Overall, I’d recommend this book: it was interesting throughout (unlike most business-y books), and even if nothing in its covers is truly new under the sun, the ideas inside are good enough to be worth reviewing periodically.

<p>
What if our most fundamental assumptions about parenting were wrong? That’s the question that Michaeleen Doucleff’s 2021 book <i>Hunt, Gather, Parent</i> tries to tackle. <i>Hunt, Gather, Parent</i> (henceforth <i>HGP</i>) documents Doucleff’s journey to “three of the world’s most venerable cultures”—the Maya, the Inuit, and the Hadzabe (in Tanzania)—to learn about how they parent their children, and offers helpful advice for parents envious of the kind, helpful, and responsible children she observes.
</p>

<p>
Doucleff’s writing hits some familiar beats: critiques of helicopter parenting, distrust of endless after-school activities, and laments about the atomization of our society (<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20230306232837/https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/03/the-nuclear-family-was-a-mistake/605536/>cf.</a>). But there are plenty of unexpected insights too. I was convicted by her account of how Hadzabe children are given autonomy and responsibilities from a young age without being either ignored or micromanaged: her vision of a middle ground between <i>K</i>-selected “helicopter parents” and <i>r</i>-selected “free-range parents” was compelling.
</p>

<p>
There’s a lot to like about the parenting depicted in <i>HGP</i>. For instance, Doucleff highlights how toddlers’ innate eagerness to help is used by the Maya to build a culture of helpfulness (the virtue she calls <i>acomedido</i>) which lasts as they grow, whereas American parents generally disregard help from a toddler and thus teach kids that their help isn’t valued. On the other hand, I’m not compelled by her account of how the Inuit view conflict with their children:
</p>

<blockquote>
Inuit see arguing with children as silly and a waste of time… because children are pretty much illogical beings. When an adult argues with a child, the adult stoops to the child’s level… During my three visits to the Arctic, I never once witness a parent argue with a child. I never see a power struggle. I never hear nagging or negotiating. Never.
</blockquote>

<p>
I admit that getting into a shouting match with your toddler is pointless, but assuming that children are innately devoid of logic seems like an overreaction! 
</p>

<p>
Astute readers might be getting bothered by now, though: why are the Maya—who ruled a swath of Central America for over a millennium—included in a book ostensibly about “hunter-gatherers and other indigenous cultures with similar values”? This highlights a deeper issue I have with <i>HGP</i>, which is that it partitions the world neatly into “Westerners” and “everyone else,” citing Joseph Heinrich’s <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WEIRDest_People_in_the_World><i>The WEIRDest People in the World</i></a> as its justification. While there are certainly many ways in which our own culture is distinct, ours is but one among many, and there’s plenty of cultural diversity about which <i>HGP</i> is silent.
</p>

<p>
For instance, Doucleff argues that in other cultures “parents build a relationship with young children… that’s based in cooperation instead of conflict, trust instead of fear.” I’m skeptical about this claim—what might we learn from some other non-WEIRD societies? 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
“In the Mendocino Codex… the daily life of Aztecs was described, including a common form of punishment for children. The Codex has a drawing of a father punishing his 11-year-old son by making the boy inhale smoke emanating from dry chiles roasting on the hearth. In the same drawing, a mother threatens her 6-year-old daughter with the same punishment” (<a href=https://journals.ashs.org/hortsci/downloadpdf/journals/hortsci/34/5/article-p809.xml>Paul Bosland</a>)
</li>

  <figcaption>
    Not exactly “gentle parenting”!
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<li>
“Roman law understands the legal power of the <i>pater familias</i> within the familia to be absolute, to the point of being able to put any member to death (this seems to have almost never happened, but it was legally permitted)” (<a href=https://acoup.blog/2023/07/21/collections-how-to-roman-republic-101-part-i-spqr/>Bret Devereaux</a>)
</li>
<li>
Yan Zhitui (Northern and Southern Dynasties, late 6th century) writes that “…as soon as a baby can recognize facial expressions and understand approval and disapproval, training should be begun so that he will do what he is told to do and stop when so ordered. After a few years of this, punishment with the bamboo can be minimized, as parental strictness and dignity mingled with parental love will lead the boys and girls to a feeling of respect and caution and give rise to filial piety. I have noticed about me that where there is merely love without training this result is never achieved.” (<a href=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/ps/cup/yan_house_instructions.pdf>quoted here</a>)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
(Granted, these cultures aren’t “indigenous,” but then neither are the Maya.)
</p>

<p>
Doucleff’s focus on partitioning the world into “the West” and “the rest” blinds her to deeper and more interesting questions. The way we parent reflects our values—there are no perfect choices in parenting, just tradeoffs all the way down. Our culture’s valorization of grindset likely helps us instill ambition and a work ethic in our children, but also probably sets them up for depression and other issues down the road. Is this a good trade? Absent an ethical framework, it’s tough to say, but <i>HGP</i> doesn’t even acknowledge the question.
</p>

<p>
There’s a deeper truth here, which is that rejecting the status quo isn’t the same as proposing an alternative. It’s not unfair to read <i>HGP</i> as an account of Doucleff becoming redpilled on parenting and realizing that all her assumptions about how to raise her children might be wrong—but, like many of the newly redpilled, Doucleff lingers too long in her rebellion and doesn’t (in <i>HGP</i>) articulate a satisfying positive vision for what parenting should be. There are innumerable cultures out there, each of which doubtless parents in a different way, and choosing what practices to adopt from each tradition requires wisdom.
</p>

<p>
But these aren’t choices we should want Doucleff to make for us. In the introduction to <i>HGP</i>, Doucleff writes that “as we move outside the U.S., we’ll start to see the Western approach to parenting with fresh eyes,” and this seems true. <i>HGP</i> prompts us to reflect on the choices we make as parents and the ways in which we might choose differently, and even if you disagree with all of Doucleff’s advice it’s worth reading for this experience alone.
</p>
