    <h1> Timescales </h1>

  For many organic chemists, it’s hard to grasp the vast difference between various “fast” units of time. 
  For instance, if a reactive intermediate has a lifetime of microseconds, does that mean it can escape the solvent shell and react with a substrate? 
  What about a lifetime of nanoseconds, picoseconds, or femtoseconds?
</p>

<p>
  To help answer these questions for myself, I made the following graphic about a year ago, which compares the timescale of various molecular processes on a logarithmic axis.
  Although someone skilled in Adobe Illustrator could doubtless make a prettier version, 
  I've still found this to be a useful reference, and frequently use it as a slide in talks or group meetings:
</p>

<figure>
  <img class="centered-img" src="../img/20220719_timescales.png" style="width:650px;" alt="illustration of chemical timescales" />
  <figcaption> Illustration of timescales of chemical processes—open in new tab for higher resolution</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  Based on this graphic, it becomes easier to think about the interplay between competing fast processes. 
  Species that persist for less than ~5 ps, for instance, are effectively “frozen” in the solvent configuration they’re formed in, 
  whereas molecules that persist for longer can sample different solvent configurations. 
  If a species can persist for 10-100 ps, it can begin to sample the nearby conformational landscape through low-barrier processes (e.g. single-bond rotation), 
  although larger conformational changes might still be inaccessible.
</p>

<p>
  As lifetimes stretch into the nanosecond regime, diffusion and solvent-cage escape become more realistic possibilities: 
  based on <a href=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.200503273>Mayr’s value</a> for the “diffusion limit” (2–4e9 M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>), 
  we can estimate that bimolecular association with a 1.0 M reactant will take 200-400 ps, while association with a 100 mM reactant will take 2-4 ns. 
  On the far right of the graph, being able to distinguish different species by NMR (e.g. amide methyl groups in DMF) means that these species have a very long lifetime indeed.
</p>

<p>
  Framed in these terms, then, it becomes obvious why the 10-100 ps timescales currently accessible by <i>ab initio</i> molecular dynamics (AIMD) are unable to model many important 
  molecular processes.  Indeed, <a href=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00833>work from Grossman and coworkers</a> 
  has shown that the results of AIMD simulations can be very dependent on the pre-AIMD equilibration method used, 
  since the actual solvent environment is unable to fully relax over the timescale of the simulation. 
  For AIMD to become a truly useful alternative to forcefield molecular dynamics, much faster <i>ab initio</i> methods will be needed!

      The lifetime given for benzophenone is for the singlet excited state, not the triplet excited state 
      (which has a much longer lifetime, explaining why benzophenone can be used as a triplet sensitizer).
      Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/DanielEFalvey/status/1549868458673901568">Daniel Falvey</a> for pointing this out.

    <li>
      The illustration of "NMR timescale" refers only to the timescale in which different peaks can be distinguished in a 1D NMR experiment.
      More sophisticated NMR experiments can probe much faster processes, such as molecular tumbling, so the use of the phrase "NMR timescale" is misleading.
