    <h1> Workflows Are the New Models </h1>
    <i>July 2, 2025</i>
    <br />
<br />
<a href="https://x.com/CorinWagen/status/1939695363427893471"><em>Expanded from a post on X</em></a><em>, which I felt didn’t do a good job expressing all of what I meant.</em>

<p>
  The past few years of “AI for life science” has been all about the models: AlphaFold&nbsp;3, neural-network potentials, protein language models, binder generation, docking, co-folding, ADME/tox prediction, and so on.  
  But <a href="https://www.chaidiscovery.com/news/introducing-chai-2">Chai-2</a> (and lots of related work) shows us that the vibes are shifting.  
  Models themselves are becoming just a building block; the real breakthroughs are going to happen at the workflow level, as we learn how to combine these models into robust and performant pipelines.
</p>

<p>
  Workflows are the new models.  
  To have a state-of-the-art computational stack for drug discovery (or protein engineering, or materials design, or anything else), it’s no longer enough to have just a single state-of-the-art model.  
  You need a suite of modular tools that you can combine in a way that makes sense for your task. (At Rowan, we’re seeing this happen all over the industry.)
</p>

<p>What does this mean in practice? Here are two imaginary case studies illustrating what modern computational chemistry looks like in 2025:</p>

<h3>Materials Science</h3>

<p>
  A company is developing a new inorganic photocatalyst for bulk acid–alkene coupling (following
  <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.0c08688">Zhu and Nocera, 2020</a>).  
  Their workflow might look something like this:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Agentic literature search for potential photo-active inorganic materials that seem synthesizable.</li>
  <li>A diffusion or flow-matching model for 3-D structure generation where crystallography data doesn’t exist.</li>
  <li>Rapid structural relaxation with a neural-network potential (NNP) to generate minimized structures.</li>
  <li>Adsorption-energy estimation with another NNP to see if alkene binding is feasible.</li>
  <li>HOMO–LUMO gap computation with periodic DFT to estimate photo-activity.</li>
  <li>Molecular dynamics to check the stability of the bound pose.</li>
  <li>Volcano-plot creation and final candidate scoring based on all properties.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The entire cycle can be repeated <em>ad nauseum</em> to generate new candidates, with the focus gradually shifting from exploration to exploitation.
</p>

<h3>Drug Discovery</h3>

<p>
  A company has identified new CNS biological targets that they hope to inhibit with a small molecule.  
  Their workflow might look something like this:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Based on a starting hit (from a DEL, or from a known binder), generate modifications automatically or by sampling from an enumerated library.</li>
  <li>Filter candidates by synthesizability, solubility, pK<sub>a</sub>, and other project-specific structural filters.</li>
  <li>Dock molecules against the target and potential anti-targets using a fast method like Vina.</li>
  <li>For hits predicted to show good selectivity, rescore with a second method (strain-corrected docking, Boltz-2, etc.).</li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00057">Run a short MD simulation</a> to check the stability of the bound pose.
  </li>
  <li>
    Screen for <a href="https://rowansci.com/publications/macroscopic-pka-prediction">blood–brain-barrier permeability</a> and
    <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemrestox.4c00015">liver toxicity</a> (e.g.).
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  This cycle, too, can be repeated until <del>you run out of Modal credits</del> a set of promising candidates is identified for synthesis.
</p>

<br />

<p>
  Neither of these case studies is based on a particular company; instead, they’re meant to illustrate the sort of ML-native workflows we’re seeing from early adopters across the chemical sciences.  
  For simplicity, experimental integration isn’t shown here, but any sane scientist will obviously incorporate wet-lab testing as soon as possible and feed those insights back into the top of the funnel.
</p>

<p>
  In any case, the overall point is clear—no single model can by itself solve every problem, and figuring out the right way to combine a set of models is itself a non-trivial system-design problem.  
  It’s entirely possible to create a state-of-the-art workflow simply by combining “commoditized” open-source models in a new way, and so far the resultant workflows don’t seem obvious or easy to copy.  
  This defies popular intuition about what constitutes a “moat” for AI companies.
</p>

<p>
  More metaphysically, the line between workflows and models is blurring.  
  Many ML-adjacent people think of models as the active unit of science: “they have a model for X” or “we’re building a model for Y.”  
  But, as shown above, most state-of-the-art research today requires lots of individual ML models, and many “models” are already miniature workflows.  
  For instance, running a single inference call through
  <a href="https://github.com/dptech-corp/Uni-pKa">the Uni-pKa “model”</a> requires enumerating all possible microstates, performing a conformer search, and running geometry optimizations on every individual conformer—just to generate the pairwise-distance matrix used as input for the actual ML model.
</p>

<p>Why does this matter? Here are a few thoughts that I've had, after thinking about this point:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Models must be plug-and-play, interoperable, and robust—anything that can’t be integrated into higher-level workflows won’t be used.</li>
  <li>
    The best models might not be those that top isolated benchmarks; in a workflow context, speed, reliability, and uncertainty
    quantification also matter.  
    Richard Hamming’s first rule of systems engineering comes to mind: “If you optimize the components, you will probably ruin the system
    performance” (<a href="https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230516_hamming.html">see my previous book review</a>).
  </li>
  <li>
    Any thinking that depends on a sharp metaphysical difference between workflows and models is probably wrong.  
    I recently had a sales call where someone told me they weren’t interested in any workflows—they only wanted to use models.  
    I wanted to send them to
    <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/21/the-categories-were-made-for-man-not-man-for-the-categories/">old Slate Star Codex posts</a>,
    but (wisely?) held my tongue.
  </li>
  <li>
    Devops and good software engineering will rise in importance.  
    At Rowan, we’ve learned firsthand how hard it is to manage hundreds of thousands of workflows across a vast sea of unruly scientific dependencies.
  </li>
  <li>
    Relatedly, the amount of scientific, computational, and engineering expertise needed to run a modern computational-science program is
    rising exponentially—and shows no signs of stopping.
  </li>
</ul>
