<h1> Software Development</h1>

<p>
The vast computational power available to scientists today has made running high-level calculations easier than ever before, but the software that most researchers use is grossly inadequate for the scientific challenges that they face. I’m involved in a number of projects that aim to empower computational chemists through powerful and easy-to-use tools.
</p>

<p>
With Eugene Kwan, I develop and maintain <a href=https://cctk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/><i>cctk</i></a>, a computational chemistry toolkit that essentially provides a Python API to several popular quantum chemistry packages. Using <i>cctk</i>, you can easily analyze completed output files, extract key data, modify geometries, and resubmit additional jobs, vastly amplifying researcher productivity.
</p>

<p>
I’m also developing <a href=https://corinwagen.github.io/presto/public/index.html><i>presto</i></a>, a <i>cctk</i>-based package for running and analyzing <i>ab initio</i> molecular dynamics simulations. Although <i>presto</i> is still in a relatively inchoate stage of development, I’ve found it to be very useful in <a href=aimd.html>a number of projects.</a>
</p>

<p>
I’ve also worked on a number of smaller projects:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    I wrote <a href=https://github.com/corinwagen/quick-fuoss><i>quick-fuoss</i></a>, a package that estimates ion-pair dissociation constants in various solvents.
  </li>
  <li>
    As a part of our collaboration with Merck to study reaction generality, I authored <a href=https://github.com/corinwagen/chromatics><i>chromatics</i></a>, a package to perform intelligent chromatographic peak deconvolution.
  </li>
  <li>
    I’ve also contributed a number of speed optimizations to <a href=https://github.com/ekwan/PyQuiver><i>PyQuiver</i></a>, a package for calculating kinetic isotope effects.
  </li>
</ul>
