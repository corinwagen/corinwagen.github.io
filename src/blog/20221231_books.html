<p>
Last January, I aimed to read 50 books in 2022. I got through 32, which is at least more than I read in 2021.
</p>

<p>
There’s been a bit of <a href=https://twitter.com/nabeelqu/status/1608874209375313920>discourse</a> around whether setting numerical reading goals for oneself is worthwhile or counterproductive. I don’t have a strong opinion in the abstract, but I noticed that consciously tracking how many books I read served as a little nudge to read more than I would otherwise, without really compromising the quality of books I was reading.
</p>

<p>
In order, then:
</p>

<b>
#1. Neal Stephenson, <i>Snow Crash</i> (reread)
</b>

<p>
I read this in high school, and wanted to read it again in light of recent Metaverse-related discourse. It didn’t disappoint, although it’s a little more “action movie” than Stephenson’s later works.
</p>

<b>
#2. Aristotle, <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>
</b>
<br>
<b>
#3. Tim Keller, <i>Prayer</i> (reread)
</b>
<br>
<b>
#4–17. Robert Jordan &amp; Brandon Sanderson, <i>Wheel of Time</i>
</b>

<p>
Beyond the surface-level plot (which is fun), <i>Wheel of Time</i> is a fascinating exploration of a number of societies structured around complementarianism at a deep level.
</p>

<b>
#18. Paul Tripp, <i>Parenting</i>
</b>

<br>
<b>
#19. Peter Thiel, <i>Zero To One</i>
</b>

<p>
I’ve discussed this book <a href=https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20220914_zero_to_one.html>previously</a>.
</p>

<b>
#20. Peter Scazzero, <i>Emotionally Healthy Spirituality</i>
</b>

<br>
<b>
#21. Eric Berger, <i>Liftoff</i>
</b>

<p>
This is a good account of the early days of SpaceX, and works well as a book-length answer to the question “What decisions or mindsets allowed Elon Musk to succeed in starting a rocket company when so many other billionaires failed?” or equivalently “What—besides money—explains SpaceX’s success?”
</p>

<p>
My summary, based on the book, would be (in no particular order): (1) a focus on recruiting top talent, (2) a “can-do” spirit / commitment to moving quickly and recklessly, (3) decisive decision-making at top levels of the organization, (4) a willingness to internalize lots of tasks to increase efficiency, and (5) luck.
</p>

<b>
#22. Roald Dahl, <i>Going Solo</i>
</b>
<br>
<b>
#23. Yiyun Li, <i>Must I Go</i>
</b>
<br>
<b>
#24. Tyler Cowen &amp; Daniel Gross, <i>Talent</i>
</b>

<p>
I’ve also discussed this book <a href=https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20220928_talent.html>previously</a>.
</p>

<b>
#25. Stanley Gundry (Ed.), <i>Five Views on Law and Gospel</i>
</b>

<p>
This book presents five different theological “takes” on the relationship between Old Testament law and the New Testament—there was much less consensus than I expected! It is interesting but scholarly, and not an easy read.
</p>

<p>
There are a whole bunch of books in this series; each author writes an essay explaining their position, and then writes brief responses to the other authors’ positions. This format should be more common!
</p>

<b>
#26. Albert Hirschman, <i>Exit, Voice, and Loyalty</i>
</b>

<p>
I discussed pieces of this book <a href="https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20221018_omelas_hirschman_altom.html">here</a>; the rest is also good.
</p>

<b>
#27. Celeste Ng, <i>Little Fires Everywhere</i>
</b>
<br>
<b>
#28. Fuchsia Dunlop, <i>The Food of Sichuan</i>
</b>

<p>
As discussed on <a href=https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/fuchsia-dunlop/> Conversations with Tyler</a>.
</p>

<b>
#29. Geoffrey Moore, <i>Crossing The Chasm</i>
</b>

<p>
This book is about 100 pages longer than it needs to be.
</p>

<b>
#30. John Owen, <i>The Mortification of Sin</i> (abridged)
</b>

<p>
As recommended <a href=https://twitter.com/timkellernyc/status/1477975783641595905>by Tim Keller</a>!
</p>

<b>
#31. Margaret Atwood, <i>Oryx and Crake</i>
</b>
<br>
<b>
#32. Alison Weir, <i>The Wars of the Roses</i>
</b>

<p>
This book is a nice account of the Wars of the Roses in the style of a novel; I didn’t know anything beyond the broad strokes, so I found it quite gripping. My biggest complaint is that the book only goes through 1471, and so doesn’t cover any of the Bosworth Field-adjacent events.
</p>

<p>
My reading this year was about 50% fiction (18 books), with the remainder mostly divided between business (5 books) and Christianity (5 books). My main goal for next year is to read more history; I didn’t end up reading very much history this year, and I miss it.
