summary: "A tiny program to estimate ion-pair dissociation constants."
---

<p>
Modeling ion-pair association/dissociation is an incredibly complex problem, and one that's often beyond the scope of conventional DFT-based techniques. 
(<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.joc.1c01823">This study</a> is a nice demonstration of how hard modeling ion-pairing can be.)
Nevertheless, it's still often important to gain insight into what the relative energy of solvent-separated ion pairs and contact-ion pairs might be;
are solvent-separated configurations energetically accessible or not? 
</p>

<p>
I've run into this problem a few times myself: in measuring pKas in nonpolar solvents, and again recently when trying to understand 
<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.orglett.2c03622">the solution structure of ethereal HCl.</a>
When digging through the pKa literature, I was surprised to learn that there's a simple and relatively accurate way to estimate the dissociation constant of contact-ion pairs, 
developed by Raymond Fuoss in the 1950s. 
</p>

<p>
Despite modeling ions as charged spheres and solvent as a featureless dielectric, the "Fuoss model" is surprisingly good at reproducing experimental data.
Here's one such example:
</p>

<p>
It's not trivial to think about how to get similar results using more atomistic methods!
(In principle one could actually model the exact solvent mixture and compute the energy of ion-pair dissociation using biased sampling and MD, but this 
would be horrendously expensive and probably less accurate anyway.)
</p>

<p>
The Fuoss model is pretty simple to implement oneself—but to make things even easier, I've implemented it as an open-source Python package, 
which can be imported using <span class=code>pip</span>.
The package contains only a single function, <span class=code>compute_kd</span>, which accepts the name of the cation, the name of the anion, and the dielectric constant of the medium.
(Alternatively, <span class=code>.xyz</span> files, <span class=code>.gjf</span> files, or <span class=code>cctk.Molecule</span> objects can also be given.)
</p>

<p>
Under the hood, the program builds molecules using <i>cctk</i>, computes their volume, and then applies the Fuoss model.
The end result is a comically simple interface:
</p>

<pre class=code-block>
$ pip install quick_fuoss
$ python
&gt;&gt;&gt; import quick_fuoss
&gt;&gt;&gt; quick_fuoss.compute_kd("sodium", "chloride", 80)
1.0793241279015366
</pre>

<p>
On the associated <a href="https://github.com/corinwagen/quick-fuoss">Github repository</a>, there's also a little command-line script which makes this even simpler:
</p>

<pre class=code-block>
$ python quick_fuoss.py tetraisoamylammonium nitrate 8.5
Reading ion #1 from rdkit...
Reading ion #2 from rdkit...
Dissociation constant:	0.00004930 M
Ionization energy: 5.873 kcal/mol
$ python quick_fuoss.py tetraisoamylammonium nitrate 11.9
Reading ion #1 from rdkit...
Reading ion #2 from rdkit...
Dissociation constant:	0.00094706 M
Ionization energy: 4.122 kcal/mol
</pre>

<p>
My hope is that this program promotes wider adoption of the Fuoss model, and in general enables more critical thinking about ion-pair energetics in organic solvents.
Please feel free to send any bug reports, complaints, etc. my way!
