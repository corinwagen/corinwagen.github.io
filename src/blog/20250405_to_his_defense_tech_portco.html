<p>With apologies to Andrew Marvell. If you haven’t read <a href=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44688/to-his-coy-mistress>“To His Coy Mistress”</a>, I fear this won’t make much sense.</p>

Had we but funding enough and time,<br>
This coyness, founder, were no crime.<br>
We would sit down, and think which way<br>
To build, and pass our slow run-rate’s day.<br>
Thou by the Potomac’s side<br>
Shouldst SBIRs find; I by the tide<br>
Of El Segundo would complain. I may<br>
Fund you ten years before the first customers pay,<br>
And you should, if you please, refuse<br>
Till the market supports dual-use.<br>
Your annual revenue should grow<br>
Vaster than Boeing’s and more slow;<br>
An hundred years should go to build<br>
Thy initial demo, until the warehouse filled;<br>
Two hundred years for full refactoring,<br>
But thirty thousand for manufacturing;<br>
An age at least for every ambition,<br>
And the last age to show your full vision.<br>
For, founder, you deserve funding most,<br>
Nor would I invest at a lower post.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at my back I always hear<br>
Palmer’s wingèd chariot hurrying near;<br>
And yonder all before us lie<br>
Investors dreaming only of exits and AI.<br>
Thy product shall no more be found;<br>
Nor, in thy bankrupt state, shall sound<br>
My echoing retweets; then competition shall try<br>
That long-preserved TAM and KPI,<br>
And your quaint slide deck fall to pieces,<br>
And into ashes all my investment theses;<br>
Raytheon’s a fine and funded prime,<br>
But none, I think, work there overtime.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now therefore, while the youthful hue<br>
Sits on thy skin like morning dew,<br>
And while thy willing employees perspire<br>
At every hour of night with resolute fire,<br>
Now let us push to master while we may,<br>
And now, like YC back in the day<br>
All at once our runway devour<br>
Than languish awaiting pricing power.<br>
Let us roll all our strength and all<br>
Our funding up into one ball,<br>
And push our MVP with rough excess<br>
Through the government procurement process:<br>
Thus, though we cannot make the buyer<br>
Stand still, yet we will make Anduril acqu-hire.
